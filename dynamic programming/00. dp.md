## Trick to Identify
Try Multiple cases and see if greedy fails

## How to approach?
- Try all the ways - Recursion
- Take Minimum cost of all the ways

## How to think of Recursion?
- Specify what recursion to do
- Ask what should your function do

index -> F (Black Box) -> cost
I will give index, give me cost from index to N-1

- What do you know? Which index answer you know? What is the smallest sub-problem you know?
n-1 -> F -> n-1   => 0 cost

##  A-Frog-I

4
10 30 40 20     i->i+1  i->i+2

f() {
    if(ind == n-1) return 0;
    oneJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+1]) + f(ind+1);
    twoJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+2]) + f(ind+2);
    return min(oneJump, twoJump);
}

f() {
    if(ind == n-1) return 0;

    if(dp[ind] != -1) return dp[ind];

    oneJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+1]) + f(ind+1);
    twoJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+2]) + f(ind+2);
    return dp[ind] = min(oneJump, twoJump);
}


Recursive -> Top Down
Iterative -> Bottom Up

dp[5] = 0;
for(int i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
    oneJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+1]) + dp[ind+1];
    twoJump = abs(a[ind] - a[ind+2]) + dp[ind+2];
    dp[i] = min(oneJump, twoJump);
}

## Print Answers
Take help of DP array and orignal array

void printPaths(int dp[]) {
    int ind = 0;
    cout << ind << " ";
    while(ind < n) {
        if(dp[ind] - abs(arr[ind] - arr[ind+1]) == d[[ind+1]]) 
            ind += 1;
        else
            ind += 2;

        cout << ind << " ";
    }
}



1. f() -> ?
2. solve one step, rest next guys will do

don't overcomplicate in DP. Do your job and let others do there job.


## remember the previous
- by storing the prev index(but it may be larger)
- by storing a flag 0/1

## space optimization
use variables instead of dp array
